- Setup
	- How to get an API Token?
		- Goto the Developer Section of your bot and Copy token from there
	- Where do you put it to work with your code?
		- In a .env file in same directory of your bot.py
	- dependencies (what packages need to be installed to run the code)
		- Had to install pip, python3, discord.py and python dotenv
- Usage
        - I changed an entire section of the code to give a shout out to the Wright State Call of Duty Team whenever you type 'Go Raiders'. 
	- Command to use is Go Raiders!
	- Command will result saying goodluck to the team and when they play.
- Research
        - you may have realized that it is lame that it only runs
	  when you run the program.
          In the real world
